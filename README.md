Interactive and responsive interface using Salesforce Lightning Web Components (LWC).
Secure backend using Salesforce Apex and custom objects.
Expected Outcome:
Reduced manual effort and errors in cemetery management.
Easy access to ancestry records for families.
Efficient booking and record-keeping system for administrators.
A modern, digital platform replacing traditional paper-based methods.
